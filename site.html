        newbie<br>
        first-timer, but not really<br>
        getting started<br>
        unsure<br>
        hesitant<br>
        grand<br>
        anticipation<br>
        potent<br>
        so many questions<br>
        so many feelings<br>
        so much hope<br><br>

        what are my rules?<br>
        no thesaurus?<br>
        straight out of the heart?<br>
        no going back?<br>
        what will change?<br>
        what will stay?<br>
        what style?<br><br>
        
        eating a banana<br>
        typing jerkily with one hand<br><br>
        
        what will become of this?<br>

    <h2>Some Smells</h2>
    <p>
        Some smells are nice<br>
        like some flowers or some candles.<br>
        Some smells aren’t so nice<br>
        like driving past some monoculture farm on some highway.<br>
        Some smells make you happy<br>
        like the smell of some home-cooked meal in some home.<br>
        Some smells make you sad<br>
        like some burning smell from the fire eating up your local forest.<br>
        Some smells make you reminisce<br>
        like some smell of a loved one’s home.<br>
        Some smells make you frustrated<br>
        like the metallic smell in some dilapidated place.<br>
        Some smells make you hopeful<br>
        like some earthy smell in the garden.<br>
        Some smells make you want to grab the world by its shoulders and shake or punch or force some sense<br>
        into it and then cradle it and tell it that everything will be okay even though some smells tell you that<br>
        there isn’t much hope.<br>
        But you keep hoping anyway<br>
        because you have to.<br>
